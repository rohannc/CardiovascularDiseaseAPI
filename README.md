# CardiovascularDiseaseAPI ü´Ä
# DiabetesDiseaseAPI üç¨

A comprehensive healthcare prediction system combining AI models for diabetes and cardiovascular disease prediction, along with symptom analysis using HuggingFace's API. The system is accessible through a cross-platform mobile application built with React Native.

## üìÇ Related Repositories

This project is split into two repositories:
1. **API and Models** (Current Repository): Contains the AI models and backend APIs
2. **Mobile Application**: [Healthcare Prediction App Repository](https://github.com/Soumyodeep-Das/Seva-BackSlash) - React Native mobile application that consumes these APIs

## üåü Features

- **Diabetes Prediction API**: Machine learning model to predict diabetes risk based on patient data
- **Cardiovascular Disease Prediction API**: AI model for assessing cardiovascular disease risk
- **Symptom Analysis**: Integration with HuggingFace API for preliminary symptom analysis
- **Mobile Application**: Cross-platform app built with React Native for easy access to all features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

While our AI models provide valuable insights, they should not be considered as replacements for professional medical diagnosis. Always consult healthcare professionals for medical decisions. The predictions and analyses provided are for informational purposes only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Backend APIs**: Custom AI models for health predictions
- **Symptom Analysis**: HuggingFace API integration
- **Mobile Development**: React Native
- **Cross-Platform Support**: iOS and Android

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- React Native development environment set up
- HuggingFace API key

### Installation

1. Clone both repositories:
```bash
# Clone API repository
git clone https://github.com/rohannc/CardiovascularDiseaseAPI.git
cd CardiovascularDiseaseAPI

# Clone mobile app repository
git clone https://github.com/rohannc/HealthcarePredictionApp.git
cd HealthcarePredictionApp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# For API
cd CardiovascularDiseaseAPI
npm install

# For mobile app
cd HealthcarePredictionApp
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file
- Add your HuggingFace API key:
```
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
# Start API server
cd CardiovascularDiseaseAPI
npm start

# Start mobile app
cd HealthcarePredictionApp
npm start
```

## üì± Mobile Application

The mobile application provides an intuitive interface to access all prediction models:

- Diabetes risk assessment
- Cardiovascular disease prediction
- Symptom analysis and preliminary diagnosis
